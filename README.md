# Anomaly-Detection-in-Times-Series-Data-with-Keras
This repository is the product of the Coursera Project Network called Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data with Keras, teaching by professor Snehan Kekre

The script develops an anomaly detection model using deep learning. 
The procces was made by designing and training an LSTM autoencoder using the Keras API with Tensorflow 2 as the backend to detect
anomalies (sudden price changes) in the S&P 500 index. 
It also contains interactive charts and plots using Plotly Python and Seaborn for data visualization and display the result in Jupyter notebooks. 

# Key words
- Build an LSTM Autoencoder in Keras.
- Detect anomalies with Autoconders in time series data.
- Create interactive charts and plots with Plotly and Seaborn.
